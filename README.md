# tS Requirements
These are the requirements and specifications for translationStudio. The projects using these requirements are

* [tS Android](https://github.com/Door43/translationStudio2)
* [tS Desktop](https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/ts-desktop)

##Format
The requirements are written in [Gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin) so that they can be ran through [Cucumber](https://cukes.info/).

##Purpose
These requirements provide a unified definition of features to be implimented in tS. This allows for more reliable testing, better collaboration, and helps to maintain focus on the long term goals of tS.

##Uses
There are several practical ways in which these requirements may be used, below are a few for starters

* Unit tests
* Acceptance testing - [PioneerJs](http://pioneerjs.com/)

##Collaboration
Live collabration is temporarily at [etherpad.net](https://etherpad.net/p/userstories).
