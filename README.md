# temp-ts-requirements
This is the temporary location for the requirements for the tS app

The requirements are written in [Gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin) so that they can be ran through [Cucumber](https://cukes.info/).

Live collabration is currently at [etherpad.net](https://etherpad.net/p/userstories)
> Keep in mind that copying out of etherpad does not maintain the tabbing.
